              <p>Global Terrorism trended upwards significantly in recent decades; In 1970 there were 65 fatal attacks worldwide, but in 2019 there were 4474. Although, 
                only roughly half of the attacks over this period were fatal, the fatal attacks claimed more than 140,000 lives. These attacks occur across the globe
                 in different situations and have been attributed to more than 2000 name perpetrators. Thus, this visualization will look into trends in the large variety 
                 of fatal terrorist attacks over the period 1970-2019.</p>

              font-family: 'Georama', sans-serif;">The Increase in Terrorism and its Regionality</h2>
              <p>	Both time-series charts below show the clear increase in terrorist attacks, and conequently fatalities due to terrorist attacks, over the timeframe. However,
                there is variance in the prevalance of each attack type over the period, with no discernible pattern.
                Though terrorism is a global issue it is certainly concentrated in some regions more than others. The choropleth map suggests that India, 
                and nearby countries, Central America, and the Middle Eastern regions have the greatest incidence of fatal terrorist attacks. The distribution of the circles representing
                significant terrorist attacks too suggests that some regions have a greater terrorism threat than others.</p>
              <p style="color: grey;">Description: The layered map has a choropleth map showing the number of fatal terrorist attacks for each country over the entire 
                1970-2019 period. While the circles on top show the location of terrorist attacks that had more than 100 fatalities, with the size of the 
                circle representing the number of fatalities. The Line chart can be used to filter the attacks shown by year, and it also filters the area 
                chart too. The legend on the area chart can be used to filter circles shown on the map by <span class='variable-text'>type of attack</span>.</p>

              <h2 style="font-size: 30px;">The Outlier Countries and Target Type</h2>
              <p>	The regionality of terrorist threats becomes even more apparent when the top 30 countries with the most terrorist attacks are isolated. 
                The majority of the countries are from the Middle East, Central America, the Indian Subcontinent or Africa. The most 
                notable exceptions being the United Kingdom and Spain, the only countries from Eastern Europe, and even then they have comparatively 
                few attacks when comparing against the top 10 countries. We can also show the most prevalent <span class="variable-text">attack targets</span>, by comparing them against the 
                top 30 countries. It appears that Military, Government, Police and Private Citizens/Property are most often the target of terror 
                attacks</p>
              <p style="color: grey;">Description: The heatmap shows the general trend in <span class="variable-text">target type</span> across the top 30 countries with the greatest fatal terrorist attacks, 
                and a tooltip is available for specific details. The bar chart above shares the same country axis, and plots the total number of 
                attacks for the respective countries over the period 1970-2019</p>

              <h2 style="font-size: 30px;">Most Fatal Attacks, by Attack and Weapon Type</h2>
              <p>Having looked at the prevalence of <span class="variable-text">attack types</span> for all fatal attacks, we can also look at the distribution of <span class="variable-text">attack types </span> in 
                substantial terrorist attacks (>25 fatalities and wounded). The most prevalent <span class="variable-text">attack types </span> in these substantial attacks are 
                Bombings and Assaults, where other types have comparatively little prevalence. Furthermore, in filtering by the 
                weapon type used in the attack we can view the relationships between <span class="variable-text">weapons used </span> and <span class="variable-text">attack types </span>. Interestingly Explosives were by far 
                the most common category of weapon used in attacks, followed by Firearms. </p>
              <p style="color: grey;">Description: The chart can be filtered by <span class="variable-text">weapon type</span> by using the drop down menu, and filtered by <span class="variable-text">attack type</span> by clicking on 
                categories in the legend. Furthermore, you can zoom and pan the chart to investigate the more dense clusters of dots in detail.</p>

              <h2 style="font-size: 30px;">The Relationship between Attack and Target Type</h2>
              <p>We can also analyze fatal terrorist attacks by their <span class="variable-text">attack type - target type</span> relationship, to determine if there is any trends 
                for particular combinations. The diagram only shows the significant relationships and reiterates that Assault and Bombings are the most common <span class="variable-text">attack types</span>, and shows that Private Citizens/Property is
                the most common <span class="variable-text">target type</span> of all. Consequently, it is unsurprising that the most common relationship is Bombings/Explosions targeting Private 
                Citizens/Property.</p>
              <p style="color: grey;">Description: The Sankey chart shows all <span class="variable-text">attack type - target type</span> relationships that are significant; connected together in more than 1000 fatal terrorist attacks (between 
                1970-2019). The tooltip can display the exact number of connections (and the proportion of total connections) for each node and link. Additionally, by clicking
              on a node yo ucan view only the links in/out of that node.</p>
